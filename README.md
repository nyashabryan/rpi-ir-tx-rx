IR Tx and Rx on a RPi
----------------------
----------------------

The project concerns the transmission of data from one RPi
to another via infrared. The transmitted data is received from
the WiFi socket before transmission. 

The data is in the form (X, Y, Z) where X, Y, Z 
are 8 bit numbers. X represents the frequency of the sound to be 
played, Y represents the amplitude at which the frequency will be 
played and Z represents the duration for playing the sound.
